Note:,"Foods and ingredients listed for foodborne outbreaks include confirmed and suspected vehicles, if identified. CDC uses detailed NORS information in its analyses of the causes and risk factors of disease outbreaks. Additional NORS data should be requested for scientific studies or analyses. Please read the full disclosure before using NORS Dashboard data."
Note:,"Reporting of outbreaks to CDC is voluntary, and outbreaks are likely underreported. Because of resource constraints and competing priorities, underreporting might be especially prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in early 2020. In addition, given that outbreak data typically are verified during the year after the outbreak occurred, underreporting should be considered when interpreting data from 2019 and later years."
